Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio repository where you'll find projects showcasing my skills as a DevOps engineer. Included is a facial/biometric auth project using computer vision, machine learning, & web dev tech and an infrastructure project showcasing my ability to design & implement scalable, secure, cloud-based infra using Terraform, Jenkins, and Ansible. Both are open-source and actively maintained.
